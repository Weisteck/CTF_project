### Passive Learning

It's a beginning, but as you can see on the pyramid, it's only a small part of learning process.

### Active Learning

Without pratice and a real-life situation, all the theory in the world will not be enough to know how we can react.

## Documentation 

1. Overview
2. Structure
3. Clarity

For screenshots "flameshot" can be a nice and powerfull tool. [Github Flameshot](https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot)

The rules for a good documentation :
> 1. It will be beneficial to put yourself in the position of your reader. This will make it much easier for you to design the documentation.
> 2. Avoid repetition and ambiguity.
> 3. Make your documentation as easy as possible. No one wants to read the documentation in which they first have to find their way around to understand what the subject is.
