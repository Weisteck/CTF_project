| `Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks`                                                                                                  | The integration and combination of different tools enable us to carry out many large and complex tasks, such as processing or filtering specific data results. |
| `Avoid captive user interfaces`                                                                                                                                | Linux is designed to work mainly with the shell (or terminal), which gives the user greater control over the operating system.                                 |
| `Configuration data stored in a text file`                                                                                                                     | An example of such a file is the `/etc/passwd` file, which stores all users registered on the system.                                                          |
